# awesome-hacks

Taking submissions for the [inaugural hack swap](http://ire.org/events-and-training/event/2702/2988/) at NICAR 2017.

#### Session description

> In the last year you’ve built a bit of code that someone else needs. Buried deep in your github is a half week of work, doomed to repeat itself by newsroom developers just like you, over and over. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Dedup the world and come to the inaugural hack swap. Think of it as a flea market of code, this session is designed to encourage sharing of code bits nearly great and small.

> We’ll take early submissions and organize a handful of lightning demos of open-source code ready to share today and lead a chat with other devs and journo coders about your most nearly-there project. We’ll also write up everyone’s OS code with short synopses and links for a future Source post.

> Come be part of the news nerd sharing economy.

#### The goal

Many of us work in small teams and all of us rely on shared code to make us faster and better at what we do.

So far the mechanism for sharing code has revolved around larger projects usually at a later stage in development. A large number of the most successful open source projects are those published by developers at larger newsrooms. We want to diversify the scale and community of open source sharing in journalism.

We think we can blah blah blah by blah blah blahing all over the blah blah blah.
