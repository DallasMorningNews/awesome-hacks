List of small open source code projects by journalists for journalists for [Inaugural Hack Swap](http://ire.org/events-and-training/event/2702/2988/) session at NICAR 2017.

Saturday, May 4, 2017, 2:15 - 3:15 p.m.

#### Session description

> In the last year you’ve built a bit of code that someone else needs. Buried deep in your github is a half week of work, doomed to repeat itself by newsroom developers just like you, over and over. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Dedup the world and come to the inaugural hack swap. Think of it as a flea market of code, this session is designed to encourage sharing of code bits nearly great and small. 

> We’ll take early submissions and organize a handful of lightning demos of open-source code ready to share today and lead a chat with other devs and journo coders about your most nearly-there project. We’ll also write up everyone’s OS code with short synopses and links for a future Source post.

> Come be part of the news nerd sharing economy.
