[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Awesome bits of code built and tested in newsrooms for the purpose of enabling smarter, faster and better journalism.

#### NICAR 2017

This list supplements the [Hack Swap](http://ire.org/events-and-training/event/2702/2988/) session at [NICAR 2017](http://ire.org/conferences/nicar2017/).

**2:15 p.m. - 3:15 p.m., Saturday | City Terrace 12**



##### Session description

> In the last year you’ve built a bit of code that someone else needs. Buried deep in your github is a half week of work, doomed to repeat itself by newsroom developers just like you, over and over. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Dedup the world and come to the inaugural hack swap. Think of it as a flea market of code, this session is designed to encourage sharing of code bits nearly great and small.

> We’ll take early submissions and organize a handful of lightning demos of open-source code ready to share today and lead a chat with other devs and journo coders about your most nearly-there project. We’ll also write up everyone’s OS code with short synopses and links for a future Source post.

> Come be part of the news nerd sharing economy.

#### An awesome list with a sense of purpose!

Many of us work in small teams or alone in our newsrooms. All of us rely on shared code to make us faster and better at what we do.

We want to help diversify the scale and community of open source sharing in journalism. Everyone can contribute their bit. Whether it's a few lines of bash to ease a public data import to a new framework, we think sharing code, especially nearly-great and small code, adds to the overall health of journalism and, by extension, of democracy.

Seriously, we said that once.


#### How you can participate

Send a pull request to this repo with your awesome news hack as per our [contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and come to the Hack Swap session at NICAR 2017 to tell others about your awesome hack and what it do.


#### What kinds of projects should be here

Simply put: We're looking for code that clearly enables journalism.

What that means is open to welcome debate, but here are some ins and outs we have in mind:

##### In
- Couple lines of bash that help process election data
- JavaScript library that helps present responsive charts

##### Likely out
- A React plugin that renders an awesome date picker
- Code closely tied to a specific story that can really only be used to replicate the same story
